# Design Pattern Singleton
> Analysis and implementation of the Singleton Design Pattern

![Singleton](https://github.com/AminEhsan/DesignPattern-Singleton/blob/main/1.png) 

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## How to run Python
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Output :
> Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance

#### Structure :
```
├── main.py
```
